	<img src="data.bmp"/> <!-- the address redirect gadget from frame_sk3.html points here. luckily, this bmp aligns neatly in 0x1000 memchunks so it's easier to work with than the initial exploit context on that page. for every 0x1000 byte identical chunk, we thus have:
	
	u32 target address 0x09040000  (from previous "sub r0, r0, #0x2c ; ldr r0, [r0] ; ldr r1, [r0] ; vmov.f32 s0, s16 ; ldr r2, [r1, #8] ; mov r1, r4 ; blx r2")
	u32 whatever
	u32 stack pivot ldm r0, {r2, r4, ip, sp, lr, pc} (r0 is chunk + 0)
	u32 stack pivot address chunk + 0x20
	u32 whatever stack pivot link register
	u32 stack pivot POPPC
	u32 whatever * 2
	u32 POPPC slide to from chunk + 0x20 to chunk + 0x100
	u32 chunk + 0x100 = 3ds_browserhax_common payload (this is about 0x580 or so and handles loading the rest of the hbmenu chain)
	u32 whatever to chunk + 0xFFF
	u32 chunk + 0x1000... next identical chunk every 0x1000 until the end! 
	
	Note: care was taken not to overwrite the bmp header (bottom of image). Also, the "w/<3 zoogie 2023" text was positioned not to interfere with our rop.
